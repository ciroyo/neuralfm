# NeuralFM

NeuralFM's mission is to put you in control of the AI's feeding you information.

Say goodbye to factory farmed algorithms from megacorps that destroy your life. NeuralFM offers a novel solution to the biggest problem nobody knows about: algorithm bias.

Some Google engineer is probably going to decide the next President of the United States. It's bad enough when megacorps purposefully bias algorithms (it really is). What's shocking though, is even with small algorithms, and even when unintended, human bias infects AI. Even worse, AI are "black boxes"â€”many of the creators don't fully understand what's happening inside.

Neural Networks ("AI") are shaping your reality, but they're increasingly out-of-reach. Neural Networks are too powerful be left to the megacorps.

NeuralFM puts an AI in your pocket and it puts you in control. It creates an open market for the best AI for all the information channels you care about. And it puts everything on the blockchain, so you can be sure about exactly what's going into your algorithms.

Now, you might be thinking....creating your own AI sounds pretty difficult. But it's not! In fact you'd be shocked how easy it is.


Creating an AI in NeuralFM is as simple as clicking a button. Seriously, that's it.

NerualFM is three things:
- An information feed giving you the best information on topics you care about
- A radio station to discover channels from the best curators
- A neural studio, to create your own AI with a few clicks (or modify someone else's)

## Getting Started

    git clone ...

    npm install

## Creating Plugins

Plugins come in 4 types

1. Scrapers
2. Feature Extractors
3. Normalizers
4. Networks

Scrapers pull in data to the system.

Feature Extractors decide which parts of the data are important.

Normalizers convert those data features into a similar format.

Networks are Neural Networks, they're plug-and-play.

To create a new plugin, view the existing plugins and copy it to your new plugin filename.

Replace all the metadata like `description`, `author` and `paymail` with your information.

Test your code locally, and when you're ready, submit it to the NeuralFM market.

You can offer your plugin for free or charge. Welcome to the NeuralFM AI Marketplace.

## TODO
// TODO: test scraping data & getting fingerprints
// TODO: test extracting features plugin & getting fingerprints of feature extracts
// TODO: test normalize plugin & getting fingerprints of feature normalization code 
// TODO: add DB ingestion to core, pulling in scraped data and providing central API for accessing and updating information
// TODO:   - make it easy to plug in custom test adapters so we don't have to hit the database or could easily create a test database we can wipe
// TODO: add classifcation to CORE...think about fingerprint,output ...who did it? when? hash of that on chain
// TODO: add network plugin with ability to customize neural network architecture
// be thinking about plugins
// be thinking about snapshotting data to the blockchain
