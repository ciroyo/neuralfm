# NeuralFM

NeuralFM's mission is to put you in control of the AI's feeding you information.

Say goodbye to factory farmed algorithms from megacorps that destroy your life. NeuralFM offers a novel solution to the biggest invisible: algorithm bias.

Some Google or Facebook engineer is probably going to decide the next President of the United States. It's bad enough when megacorps purposefully bias algorithms (it really is). What's shocking though, is even with small algorithms, and even when unintended, human bias infects AI. Even worse, AI are "black boxes"â€”many of the creators don't fully understand what's happening inside.

Neural Networks ("AI") are shaping your reality, but they're increasingly out-of-reach. AI is too powerful be left to the megacorps.

NeuralFM puts an AI in your pocket and it puts you in control. It creates an open market for the best AI for all the information channels you care about. And it puts everything on the blockchain, so you can be sure about exactly what's going into your algorithms.

Now, you might be thinking.... creating your own AI sounds pretty difficult... But it's not! In fact you'd be shocked how easy it is.


Creating an AI in NeuralFM is as simple as clicking a button. Seriously, that's it.

NerualFM is three things:
- An information feed giving you the best information on topics you care about
- A radio station to discover channels from the best curators
- A neural studio, to create your own AI with a few clicks (or modify someone else's)

## Getting Started

    git clone ...

    npm install

## Creating Plugins

If you're a developer, you may be interested in doing more than just classification, you may be interested in adding new data sources, training on different features, normalizing in a different way, or using a different neural network.

Plugins are easy to build, they're just Javascript functions: they come in 4 types

1. Scrapers
2. Feature Extractors
3. Normalizers
4. Networks

To create a new plugin, view the existing plugins and copy it to your new plugin filename.

Replace all the metadata like `description`, `author` and `paymail` with your information.

Test your code locally, and when you're ready, submit it to the NeuralFM market.

You can offer your plugin for free or charge. Welcome to the NeuralFM AI Marketplace.

What are the different plugins you can build?

### Scrapers

Scrapers pull in data to the system. Here's an example of a simple scraper:

### Feature Extractors

Feature Extractors decide which parts of the data are important.

### Normalizers

Normalizers convert those data features into a similar format.

### Networks

Networks are Neural Networks, they're plug-and-play.

## TODO
- [ ] Create new neural network (studio)
- [ ] Show tweets on frontend
- [ ] Switch between channels

- [ ] Train script to update weights

- [ ] Create a new neural network
- [ ] Classify it
- [ ] Train it
- [ ] Save it as a channel

- [ ] Image mode
- [ ] Editor mode
- [ ] Classification mode

## BONUS ROUND
- [ ] snapshot hashes of data models on chain

## BEFORE GOING LIVE
- [ ] SSL certificate
- [ ] Error boundary
- [ ] Copywriting

## NICE TO HAVE
- [ ] Custom Colors ...just something a little unique
- [ ] A few icons here and there would make a big different ("like on the create button")
- [ ] Loading spinner before side loads (with timout and error message)
- [ ] training with callback to provide UI updates
- [ ] cancel training in middle

- [ ] model is getting detached when server resets or client closes website....need to wake up socket automatically when client reconnects

## INSANE MODE
- [ ] implement twetch source to start testing multi data normalization
- [ ] scrape a lot of twitter history
